## Generalized Measures of Anticipation and Responsivity in Online Language Processing  



### Experiments and Analysis
To reproduce our experiments in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10728), first run the notebook
`analysis/emnlp2024/crossvalidation.ipynb`, then `analysis/emnlp2024/analysis.ipynb`. 


### Data
The Aligned dataset in the `data` folder is taken from the [prediction-resource](https://github.com/Andrea-de-Varda/prediction-resource) repository. Please cite the correct associated papers: 

- [de Varda et al., 2023](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-023-02261-8) for the dataset of aligned cloze probabilities, predictability ratings, EEG and reading time data.
- [Frank et al., 2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-012-0313-y) for the eye-tracking and self-paced reading time data.
- [Frank et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093934X14001515) for the dataset of event-related brain potentials.
